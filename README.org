* FDrawable
  FDrawable is a rehash of [[https://github.com/atermenji/IconicDroid][IconicDroid]] which uses a different
  approach to accessing icon fonts such as [[http://fontawesome.io][Font Awesome]].

  IconicDroid provides the essential drawable
  implementation [[https://github.com/atermenji/IconicDroid/blob/46612af9bedf3ef3e85f3b22044898a54a1348f7/library/src/com/atermenji/android/iconicdroid/IconicFontDrawable.java][IconicFontDrawable]], but it also includes several
  specific fonts and enumerates glyphs they provide. This makes it
  impossible to use other fonts are newer versions of included fonts
  withoug modifying the library itself. With FDrawable, users
  register their font assets and create drawable for desired symbol
  simply by specifying symbols Unicode code point.

  IconicDroid is packaged as Android library in apklib format, which
  is now deprecated. FDrawable is packaged as .aar and is built with
  [[http://www.gradle.org][Gradle]].
